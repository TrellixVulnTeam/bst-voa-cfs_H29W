       	 <p>Uploaded reports can take up to [X] minutes to validate. During this time, the file will be scanned for viruses, and the report data will be checked to ensure it meets the <a href="#">BAR submission standards (opens in a new tab)</a>.

  		     </p>
     	 <p>Once the process of checking is complete, you will be notified by email. You will then need to return the service in order to check, correct (if required) and submit the uploaded reports, and add any supporting documents that are necessary.</p>
